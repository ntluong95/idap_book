## Learning objectives

1. Understand what Google Colab is and its advantages for data science and AI
2. Learn how to access and navigate Google Colab
3. Create and manage notebooks in Google Colab
4. Run Python code in Colab cells
5. Use text cells for explanations and formatting
6. Import and use pre-installed libraries for data analysis
7. Import and use data to perform analysis
7. Share Colab notebooks

## Introduction

Google Collaboratory, or Colab for short, is a free online platform that allows you to work with Python or R code in your browser. It's a great way to get started with Python, as you don't have to install anything on your computer.

Some limitations if you're running heavy workload though. Can get timeout. But for beginner data analysts, it's perfect and free.

## Getting Started with Colab

1. Search for "Google Colab" in your browser
2. Usually the first option. Currently, it's colab.research.google.com, but it may change in the future.
3. Sign in with your Google account (create a Gmail account if you don't have one)

## Creating and Managing Notebooks

- Notebooks are the main way to organize work in Colab. They contain code cells and text cells.
- Create a new notebook: File > New Notebook
- Rename your notebook for better organization

## Working with Code Cells

- Code cells are where you write and execute Python code
- Type 1 + 1 in a cell then run it
- Run a cell by clicking the play button or using keyboard shortcuts:
  - Command + Enter: Run the current cell
  - Shift + Enter: Run the current cell and create a new one below
- Try to get comfortable with keyboard shortcuts


- May take a while to run the first time. See it's using Python
- Can change runtime to R actually




- When you run a cell, the output is displayed below the cell
- To see multiple outputs, explicitly print them

## Text Cells

- Use text cells for explanations and titles
- The toolbar makes formatting easy, but pay attention to the generated markdown

## Example of working with data

1. Click on the files tab to see the sample_data folder
2. Import the California housing test dataset:
```python
import pandas
housing_data = pandas.read_csv("/content/sample_data/california_housing_test.csv")
```
3. View the dataset by typing `housing_data` in a cell and running it

## Practice

Import the train dataset and repeat the process

## Getting data from your Drive

1. Search for "[your city] housing filetype:csv" on Google
2. Download the file
3. In the files tab, click the button to mount your drive
4. Create a folder and upload the downloaded file
5. Import it with pandas as before

## Where is your notebook saved?

- All work is automatically saved to your Google Drive
- Access your notebooks at drive.google.com in the "Colab Notebooks" folder

## Sharing and Collaborating

- Share notebooks with a link, giving viewer or editor access
- Access notebooks later from your Google Drive
- Download notebooks in various formats (ipynb, py)

## Conclusion

Google Colab provides a powerful, accessible platform for data science and AI projects. Its pre-configured environment, free access to hardware accelerators, and easy sharing features make it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced practitioners alike.
