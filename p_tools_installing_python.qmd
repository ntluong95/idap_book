# Introduction

So far in our learning sequence, you've been working mostly in Google Colab, a convenient, cloud-based environment for running Python code. Now it's time to tackle working locally on your own machine. This allows you to work offline and gives you more control over your development environment.

We'll guide you through installing Python **3.12.0** to ensure compatibility with the examples and exercises we'll cover. Let's get started!

Before we proceed, we'll split the instructions into two tracks:

- **Windows Users**
- **macOS Users**

Please follow the instructions specific to your operating system.

## Windows Users

### Step 1: Check Your Current Python Version

- Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press **Enter** to open Command Prompt.
- Type `python --version` and press **Enter**.
- If Python is installed, it will display the version number.
- **Note:** If you see a version lower than **3.12.0**, we'll proceed to install the correct version.

### Step 2: Download Python 3.12.0

- Open your web browser.
- Go to [Google](https://www.google.com) and search for **"Python 3.12.0"**.
- In the search results, find the link to **python.org** that mentions Python 3.12.0.
- Scroll down to the bottom of the Python 3.12.0 page to find the **"Windows installer (64-bit)"**. Then click on the link to download the installer.

### Step 3: Install Python

- Locate the downloaded file (usually in your **Downloads** folder).
- Double-click the installer to run it.
- **Important:** Check the box that says **"Add Python 3.12 to PATH"** at the bottom of the installer window.
- If you have the option, also elect to use admin privileges.
- At the end you may be asked whether to disable path length limit. Click yes to this too.
- Wait for the installation to finish.

### Step 4: Verify the Installation

- Close your old command prompt window if it is still open.
- In your start menu, search for `cmd` to open a new command prompt.
- Type `python --version` and press **Enter**.
- You should see `Python 3.12.0`. (If you see a newer version if you already have Python on your computer. That's okay. From our IDE, we will be able to select the correct version of Python that we just installed.)

### Step 5: Run Python Locally

- In Command Prompt, type `python` and press **Enter**.
- At the `>>>` prompt, type `2 + 2` and press **Enter**.
- You should see `4`.
- Type `exit()` and press **Enter**.

**Yay!** You've successfully installed Python and you ran your first local Python command.

## macOS Users

### Step 1: Check Your Current Python Version

- Go to **Applications > Utilities > Terminal**.
- Type `python3 --version` and press **Return**.
- If Python is installed, it will display the version number.
- You may get a pop-up asking to install command line developer tools if you do not have them. Go ahead and accept and install that.
- Otherwise, you may get a pop-up asking to install something. Click **Cancel** and proceed to the next step.
- If you already have version 3.12.0 installed, you can skip the rest of the steps. If you have any other version (higher or lower), proceed to the next step.

### Step 2: Download Python 3.12.0

- Open your web browser.
- Go to [Google](https://www.google.com) and search for **"Python 3.12.0"**.
- In the search results, find the link to **python.org** that mentions Python 3.12.0.
- Ensure the URL is from **www.python.org** to avoid unofficial sources.
- Scroll down to the bottom of the Python 3.12.0 page.
- Under the **"Files"** section, find **"macOS 64-bit universal2 installer"**.
- Click on the link to download the installer.

### Step 3: Install Python 3.12.0

- Locate the downloaded `.pkg` file (usually in your **Downloads** folder).
- Double-click the installer to run it.
- Click **"Continue"** through the prompts.
- Read and agree to the license terms.
- Click **"Install"**.
- Enter your administrator password when prompted.
- Click **"Install Software"**.
- Wait for the installation to finish.
- Click **"Close"** once the installation is complete.

### Step 4: Verify the Installation

- Go to **Applications > Utilities > Terminal**.
- Type `python3 --version` and press **Return**.
- You should see `Python 3.12.0`.

### Step 5: Run Python Locally

- In Terminal, type `python3` and press **Return**.
- At the `>>>` prompt, type `2 + 2` and press **Return**.
- You should see `4`.
- Type `exit()` and press **Return**.

**Yay!** You've successfully installed Python 3.12.0 on your Mac and you ran your first local Python command.
